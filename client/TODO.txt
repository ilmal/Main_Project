Heyo!

Since you are a mod in r/minecraft server I thought I'd turn to you for this question. 

I'm messing around with creating a game server hosting site, and want to get some experience hosting for actual people. 

Would it be possible for me to share my site on the r/minecraft subreddit? I'm not looking for advertisement, I make no money from this site. Everything on there is completely free!

It would mean that members of this subreddit could get completely free servers, and in return I get experience and help with bug fixing!

Here is the site! https://servers.u1.se

Thanks for your time! : )
